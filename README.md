# Link Building Strategies and Backlinking Ideas
- [Are Link Exchanges a Legitimate SEO Strategy in 2021?](https://linkbuilder.io/link-exchange/)
- [Google Search Central -> Link schemes](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/link-schemes) note "[e]xcessive link exchanges"

- Further research required, mentioned but not endorsed: Engage a link-building service (RhinoRank, Authority Builders, Crowdo).
- Create an infographic (a dated strategy) -- from [What Type of Backlinks Does Your Business Really Need Right Now?](https://neilpatel.com/blog/what-type-of-backlinks-does-your-business-really-need-right-now/) : "[a]t the old KISSMetrics site, 47 infographics generated 2,512,596 visitors and 41,142 backlinks from 3,741 unique domains" and "...at Quicksprout, every infographic I published generated 41,487 visitors and 469 backlinks from 38 unique domains" -- when we're talking ROI creating an infographic, at least insofar as these numbers go, probably has the highest potential return.
